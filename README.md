This repository is intended to serve as documentation of my experience learning Angular 2 through the [official tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).

Summary of my additions:
- Updated the project from the now-deprecated old router to the new one
- Consolidated undocumented css styles into their proper files

Copyright and license information for all code from the tutorial can be found in the `LICENSE` file.
